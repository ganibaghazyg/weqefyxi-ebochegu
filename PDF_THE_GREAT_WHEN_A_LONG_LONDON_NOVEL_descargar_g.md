Overview

    
        
            A propulsive tour through a   fantastical London, where history and myth collide, murder stalks the streets   and the mundane becomes very magical indeed.
            
            The year is 1949, the city London. Amidst the smog of the capital is Dennis   Knuckleyard, a hapless eighteen-year-old employed by a second-hand bookshop.   One day, on an errand to acquire books for sale, Dennis discovers a novel   that simply does not exist. It is a fictitious book, a figment from another   novel. Yet it is physically there in his hands. How?
            
            Dennis has stumbled on a book from the Great When, a magical version of   London beyond time and space, where reality blurs with fiction and concepts   such as Crime and Poetry are incarnated as wondrous, terrible beings. But this   other, magical London must remain a secret: if Dennis cannot find a way to   return this book to where it belongs, he risks bizarre and disastrous   repercussions, such as his body being turned inside out (or worse).
            
            So begins a journey delving deep into the city&#039;s occult underbelly and   tarrying with an eccentric cast of sorcerers, gangsters, and murderers - some   from legend, some all too real, and all with plans of their own. Soon Dennis   finds himself at the centre of an explosive series of events that may alter   and endanger both Londons forever.
            
            Thrilling, lyrical and sparkling with dark humour, The Great When is the   first book in a new series by Sunday Times-bestseller and icon, Alan   Moore.
            
            &#039;A breathless time-travelling classic. Savage, humane, comic, terrifying&#039;   Iain Sinclair
            
            &#039;Brilliant and so powerfully imaginative&#039; Adam Curtis
            
            &#039;A masterful step from one of our very best, uncompromising storytellers;   Moore peels back the layers of London and reveals not only the history we   know, but the histories that could have been, and, underneath it all, both   the dark and beautiful truths about who we are as a nation.&#039; Heather Parry
